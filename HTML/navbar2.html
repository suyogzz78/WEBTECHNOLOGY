            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Web technologies refer to the tools, techniques, and standards that enable the development and functioning of websites and web applications. These technologies form the backbone of the modern internet, connecting people, businesses, and systems globally. Their rapid evolution has transformed communication, commerce, and innovation.</p>
            <h3>Components of Web Technologies</h3>
            <h4>Frontend Technologies</h4>
            <p>Frontend refers to the client-side of a web application where users interact directly.</p>
            <p>Tools: HTML (structure), CSS (styling), JavaScript (interactivity).</p>
            <p>Frameworks: React, Angular, and Vue.js enhance development speed and scalability.</p>
            <h4>Backend Technologies</h4>
            <p>Backend powers the server-side, managing data and business logic.</p>
            <p>Languages: PHP, Python, Ruby, Node.js, Java, and .NET.</p>
            <p>Databases: SQL (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) and NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB).</p>
            <p>Servers: Apache, NGINX.</p>
            <h4>APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)</h4>
            <p>APIs facilitate communication between different software systems. REST and GraphQL are prominent API types.</p>
            <h4>Web Protocols and Standards</h4>
            <p>HTTP/HTTPS ensures secure communication.</p>
            <p>WebSockets and WebRTC enable real-time data exchange.</p>
            <p>W3C defines web standards for interoperability.</p>
            <h3>Emerging Trends in Web Technologies</h3>
            <p>Progressive Web Apps (PWAs): Apps that work offline and provide near-native app experiences.</p>
            <p>AI Integration: Smart web applications, personalized experiences through AI and ML.</p>
            <p>WebAssembly: High-performance web applications powered by low-level bytecode.</p>
            <p>Serverless Architectures: Simplifies backend by allowing cloud providers to manage the infrastructure.</p>
            <h3>Impact on Society and Business</h3>
            <p>Accessibility and Inclusivity: Web technologies connect billions, offering access to education, healthcare, and remote work opportunities.</p>
            <p>E-Commerce Growth: Platforms like Amazon and Shopify rely on advanced web technologies for seamless shopping experiences.</p>
            <p>Media and Communication: Technologies enable platforms like YouTube, WhatsApp, and Zoom, revolutionizing how people interact globally.</p>
            <h3>Challenges in Web Technologies</h3>
            <p>Security Risks: Cyberattacks like phishing and data breaches remain persistent challenges.</p>
            <p>Performance Bottlenecks: Ensuring fast load times and responsiveness across all devices.</p>
            <p>Digital Divide: Bridging the gap between technologically advanced regions and underserved communities.</p>
